## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular. 


The core steps to using gt involve 

1. Initiate a git repository
     In R studio we just click a little radio button on project creation 
     At the command line we type: 
     `git init`
     
2. Do your normal work
    Add files
    modify files etc.
    
3. Add your important files to the "stage"
    In RStudio we click "staged" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`

4. Commit your staged files to the repository
    Inn RStudio you just hit the "Commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your wee msg"`
    
    
5. Git push to sync changes to GitHub
  The Up arrow in RStudio
  `git push`
  
6. Git Pull to sync FROM GitHub
    The down arrow in RStudio
    `git pull`

You can check your project "history" and status
